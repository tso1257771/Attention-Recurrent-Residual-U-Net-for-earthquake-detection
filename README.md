# ARRU phase picker: Attention-Recurrent-Residual-U-Net-for-earthquake-detection
We're working on a more stable model on processing continuous seismograms as well as an useful repository! 
Here are just the simple scripts for model training and prediction using STandford Earthquake Dataset (STEAD) dataset.
